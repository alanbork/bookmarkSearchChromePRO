# bookmarkSearchChromePRO
"Full featured" flat bookmark manager designed for keyboard use. Incrementally search bookmarks with a hotkey (default is alt+b), and edit/delete by right clicking. For chrome (v3 manafest).
Search results are sorted by frequency of use.

For a simple searcher (no editing): https://github.com/alanbork/bookmarkSearchChrome


# Installation 
This is distributed as an unpacked extension to ensure it is easy to look at the code before installing it. Click the most recent release on the right-hand side of the screen; download and extract the source to a separate folder.
To install an unpacked extension go to chrome://extensions/ and click the "load unpacked" button (you may need to enable developer mode) and select the folder. If you delete the folder later the extension will be rudely uninstalled. 

# Permissions
 
    "bookmarks", should be self explanatory, but if not this is probably the wrong tool for you
    "tabs", so we can open the bookmark
    "history", so we can sort the search results by frequency
    "storage", so we can remember the last bookmark visited using this tool
